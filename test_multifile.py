    Chapter 1: Introduction

    This is a sample text for testing the multi-file processing functionality
    of the Audify application. This text will be converted to speech using
    the text-to-speech engine.

    Chapter 2: Features

    The enhanced Audify application now supports:
    - Multiple file processing
    - Real-time progress monitoring
    - Job cancellation capabilities
    - Batch operations with different settings

    This concludes our sample text for testing purposes.
